\section{Introduction}

This memo lays out the results of some initial radio environment testing in and 
around Rangely, Colorado. It also aims to lay out some analysis of what these 
results mean for the HYPERION instrument and suggests some new ideas for 
mitigation of environmental factors.

\section{Background and Theory}

One aspect of the HYPERION instrument that has yet to be finalized is its 
location -- where the instrument will be deployed to do the science it is 
designed to accomplish. Since its inception, there has been frequent discussion 
of using a site near Rangely, Colorado -- a tiny town in northwestern Colorado, 
far removed from most typical sources of radio transmission and peppered with 
convenient geology. With low RFI and a somewhat quieter radio sky, it seemed 
like an ideal candidate in theory. So, we put it to the test -- what does the 
radio environment around Rangely actually look like in the HYPERION frequency 
band? And, assuming it's a good starting point, how can we optimize it to our 
peculiar needs?

To answer these questions, a series of three tests were conducted: one in the 
driveway of Aaron Parsons' parents house, one up a box canyon with limited N-EW 
exposure a short drive northeast, and another box canyon with limited exposure 
in all directions about 15 miles southwest. This changing directional exposure 
allowed us to begin investigating the effects of geological structure on the 
radio environment -- in particular, to see if rock formations around our 
antennas could serve as attenuators of ground-based sources of RFI. 

In each of these tests, a broadband dipole was hooked up to the FieldFox 
spectrum analyzer and used to record all that it picked up in a given frequency 
band (either 80-110 MHz or 0-300 MHz). Each spectra held 1001 points and was 
averaged for approximately 1 minute, collecting a maximum, minimum, and average 
spectrum for each recording.

        In this figure, we can see how the receiver temperature contributed to 
        the overall system. Ideally, we would like to be able to lower the 
        system temperature to the point where the synchrotron sky is the main 
        term across the band. However, as is evident above, the receiver chain 
        used in this particular testing trip introduced about 3400 K in 
        brightness temperature, drowning out all but the absolute lowest 
        frequencies of the synchrotron sky. All in all, the synchrotron sky is 
        approximately 5 dB down from the overall system temperature at 70 MHz. 
        In future testing, we will need to develop a lower temperature signal 
        chain to mitigate this effect.
